Reversal

The whole idea is that...

given an algorithm or function f
with a domain D
and a range R

x e D
y e R
when f(x) = y

if we know y
if we don't know x

the purpose of Reversal is to find f-1 and x' such that
f-1(y) = x'
f(x') = y
x and x' e X where X designates the set of values such that f(i e X) = y

x, x' and y may be numbers or complex data structures
